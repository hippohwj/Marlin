 * Buffer state is a single 32-bit variable where following data is combined.

 * - 18 bits refcount
 * - 4 bits usage count
 * - 10 bits of flags
 *
 * Combining these values allows to perform some operations without locking
 * the buffer header, by modifying them together with a CAS loop.

 * The definition of buffer state components is below.

// Get refcount and usage count from buffer state
// refcount: holds the number of PostgreSQL processes currently accessing the associated stored page.
// It is also referred to as pin count. When a process accesses the stored page,
// its refcount must be incremented by 1 (refcount++).
// After accessing the page, its refcount must be decreased by 1 (refcount--).
// When the refcount is zero, i.e. the associated stored page is not currently being accessed,
// the page is unpinned; otherwise it is pinned.

// usage_count:  holds the number of times the associated stored page has been accessed
// since it was loaded into the corresponding buffer pool slot.
